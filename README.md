Project Title

Sales Analysis Dashboard | Excel

Overview
This project is a dynamic sales analysis dashboard built using Excel. The main goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights, helping a retail shop understand its performance. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of key sales metrics, identifies top-performing products, and visualizes sales trends over time. This project was a significant learning experience for me, allowing me to apply and solidify my data analysis skills in a practical setting.

Key Features
Interactive Dashboard: The dashboard uses slicers and PivotCharts to allow users to filter data by date, product category, or region.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): It displays critical KPIs such as total sales, total revenue, average transaction value, and profit margins.

Sales Trend Analysis: A line chart visualizes sales performance over months to identify seasonal trends.

Product Performance: A bar chart ranks products by total sales, highlighting the best and worst sellers.

Geographic Analysis: A map or a table shows sales distribution across different regions or cities.

Learning and Skills
This project was a hands-on opportunity to learn and apply several key Excel skills, including:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: I performed data validation and handled missing values to ensure the data was accurate and ready for analysis.

PivotTables and PivotCharts: I learned how to use these powerful tools to summarize large datasets and create interactive charts.

Advanced Formulas: I utilized a variety of formulas like SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and GETPIVOTDATA to create calculated fields and extract specific data points.

Data Visualization: I focused on designing a clean, user-friendly dashboard that communicates insights effectively.

Dashboard Design: I learned how to structure a dashboard logically, using elements like shapes, icons, and conditional formatting to improve readability and visual appeal.
